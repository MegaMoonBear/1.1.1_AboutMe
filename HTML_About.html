    <p>Meghan worked as a Data Analyst and is upskilling to be a Data Scientist or another more technical role. She worked in a variety of jobs - mostly analytical, and in various organization types - Zoo, factory, school, and others. She wants to spend the last 15-20 years of her career using coding to support habitat conservation, reductions in wildlife trade, improving human or animal health, or something similarly idealistic efforts. See images for early brainstorming.</p>

    <p>I am practicing HTML coding for audio and video. The audio is my brothers-in-law playing live over winter holidays - Jan. 2024. The video is me talking about the classroom location for our coding class in Memphis, TN, which is near two musically famous locations.</p>
